# Chapter Expansion

Factors to consider:

- How does the program run?
- What parts of the organization need to be the same across chapters and what
  parts can change to fit the needs of individual communities?
- There will be a transition between running programs remotely and having
  people on the ground running everything.
- How self sufficient will each chapter be?
- How many programs/events will be run a year.
- Learn to *let go* and empower others. You don't want to do it all youself.

## Chapter Manuals
### They're awesome and essential

Make lots of checklists and spreadsheets. Write things down, get it out of your
head and onto paper (or the internet, of course). Something is better than
nothing. Lists of what you need in terms of logistics will be very helpful for
newbies.

Don't be afraid of putting out drafts or something you think is not
yet finished. Keep these manuals as "guides" empower others to come up with
solutions better than yours. If someone comes up with a better idea, that should
become the new standard.

(Note: There may be legal concerns that need to be outlined if working with
children.)

Focus on shipping not quality. If you're comfortable emailing something, but
not adding it to the wiki or manual... just go add it to the manual. Shipping
early and often makes the manual a place for conversation and allows everybody
to contribute their knowledge and problem solving.


## Picking Other Leaders

There's really no substitute for face-to-face interaction. It's much better to
find the time to make facetime happen, rather than getting started with the
wrong understanding of eachothers goals. Finding a person who "checks all the
boxes" will not adequately capture if they're a good match or not. However,
this is a good start if the leader needs to have a certain technical background.

**During a meeting find out:**

- Who they are and what they're about.
- What are their motivations?
- Why are they driven to do this? Why does this appeal to you?
- Do they have a history of contribution?
- What do you like about technology?

**Suggestions for selecting new teachers:**

- Have them teach you a sample lesson.
- Try their patience and see how they react.
- Ask questions you get frequently in classes.
- Drill into what they say past "blog-post" level.

Beyond that find out what does not work for you. You have to ask hard questions
and see what people rant about.

**Ultimately, make sure:**

- Your intentions and methodologies are a match for what you're trying to do.
- The leaders are accessible to the audience.

Keep in mind that chapter leaders don't have to do everything. Figure out what
you expect of leaders and how much needs to happen from the same person.
This doesn't happen naturally, you can find people that don't fit your "mold"
and give yourself more options.

People will be so excited that they'll try to wedge themselves into the roles
you publicly said are available. You can find other jobs for people. If they're
just looking for a community, they may be willing to organize since it just
doesn't seem to be happening.

**Questions to determine what role best fits a person who wants to contribute:**

- What's between you, the role you want, and leadership?
- What's the difference between how you feel and this "requirement" for the
  position?
- Find out how they need to feel about the knowledge they have.

When you realize you're not going to be there at all, it changes things. *Setup
your organization in a way that anybody can help out.* Try finding little bits
for anybody to do, and articulating levels of involvement.

- What is that first step to get involved?
  - What can an assistant organizer do?
  - Giving people access, let people take ownership.
- Try assigning mentors.
  - Make sure they have a conversation first and get along.
  - Make sure they care about helping eachother.
  - Hesitancy dissipates when taking mentorship role.
- *Let go of the idea that someone else is in charge.*
