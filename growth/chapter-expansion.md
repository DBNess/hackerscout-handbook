# Chapter Expansion

Factors to consider:
- How does the program run?
- What parts of the organization need to be the same across chapters and what
  parts can change to fit the needs of individual communities?
- There will be a transition between running programs remotely and having
  people on the ground running everything.
- How self sufficient will each chapter be?
- How many programs/events will be run a year.
- Learn to *let go* and empower others. You don't want to do it all youself.

## Chapter Manuals
### They're awesome and essential

Make lots of checklists and spreadsheets. Write things down, get it out of your
head and onto paper (or the internet, of course). Something is better than
nothing. Lists of what you need in terms of logistics will be very helpful for
newbies.

Don't be afraid of putting out drafts or something you think is not
yet finished. Keep these manuals as "guides" empower others to come up with
solutions better than yours. If someone comes up with a better idea, that should
become the new standard.

(Note: There may be legal concerns that need to be outlined if working with
children.)

Focus on shipping not quality. If you're comfortable emailing something, but
not adding it to the wiki or manual... just go add it to the manual. Shipping
early and often makes the manual a place for conversation and allows everybody
to contribute their knowledge and problem solving.
