# Conferences (in progress)

## Where to Start

- What do you want to cover? Is your conference language or topic specific?
- How long will the conference be? List some possible ideal *dates* to hold it.
- What do you want the event to look like in an hourly breakdown?
- *How many people* will you have? Keep in mind attendees, speakers, and helpers.
- List some ideal *locations*. (If this is your first conference, sticking with
  the city you're in or one where you have connections makes it easier to
  organize.)
- Make a list of ideal *speakers, panelists, and/or workshop leaders*, and start
  reaching out to them.
- What do you want the attendees to walk away with (in terms of knowledge,
  experience, connections, etc.)?
- *Why* you want to do this event? (Write this big somewhere to look at later
  when things get difficult, which they probably will. It helps to keep
  perspective.)

## Speakers

## Locations

What to look for:

- Must be able to accommodate the number of people you require.
- Proximity to public transportation and/or major highways.
- Outlets! Gauge your relative need for electricity, and keep an eye on outlet
  locations.

Good questions to ask:

- Do you have all of the AV requirements we need? (Projector, mics, Mac/PC
  compatibility)
- If you are serving food, do you allow food or require a specific caterer?
- Will there be WiFi we can use and will it handle the number of people we have?
- Is a list of attendee names required prior to the event for building access?
